# Facilities & CapEx: Where We Stand

**26 schools. $24.7M in annual facilities costs. $21M in current revenue.**

Facilities costs exceed revenue. That's the headline. Here's why, and what the path forward looks like.

---

## 1. The Core Problem: We Built for 2,061 Students but Have 713

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| Schools open or opening | 26 |
| Total capacity | 2,061 seats |
| Current enrollment | 713 students |
| Utilization | **35%** |
| Schools with zero enrollment (pre-opening) | 9 |

We're paying full freight on buildings sized for 2,061 students while serving 713. The cost structure doesn't flex — leases are signed, security is contracted, depreciation is running.

**At capacity, the picture flips.** Revenue goes from $21M to $74.9M. Facilities drop from 118% of revenue to 33%. The model works — but only when seats are filled.

---

## 2. Where the $24.7M Goes

Annual facilities costs break into five buckets:

| Category | Annual Cost | % of Total | What It Is |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Lease | $9.4M | 38% | Rent. Fixed day 1. Cannot change. |
| Student Services | $6.9M | 28% | Food + transportation. Scales with students. |
| Variable Facilities | $3.2M | 13% | Janitorial, utilities, repairs. Partially scales. |
| Fixed Facilities | $2.9M | 12% | Security, IT maintenance, landscaping. Doesn't scale. |
| Depreciation | $2.2M | 9% | Amortized buildout costs. Fixed. |
| **Total** | **$24.7M** | **100%** | |

**The sunk cost:** $11.6M (lease + depreciation) is locked regardless of enrollment. That's 47% of total costs that we cannot touch.

**The controllable cost:** $13.0M (fixed fac + variable fac + student services) has some flex, but most of it is baseline operating cost even at low enrollment.

## 3. Cost Per Square Foot — What Each Category Actually Costs

Across 352,000 total sq ft:

| Category | $/Sq Ft |
|----------|---------|
| Lease | $26.85 |
| Student Services | $19.59 |
| Variable Facilities | $9.21 |
| Fixed Facilities | $8.38 |
| Depreciation | $6.22 |
| **Total** | **$70.25** |

Lease is the largest per-sqft cost, but student services (food + transportation) is the second largest at nearly $20/sqft. That's worth digging into — especially transportation at schools like Alpha NY ($1.2M) and Alpha HS Austin ($779K).

## 4. CapEx: $6.9M Over Approved Budget

This is the cost creep Andy flagged.

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total approved CapEx budget | $6.0M |
| Actual CapEx spend | $12.9M |
| **Overrun** | **$6.9M (+114%)** |

### Biggest Overruns

| School | Approved | Actual | Over By |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| Alpha Piedmont | $0 (no model) | $1.77M | — |
| Alpha Palo Alto | $0 (no model) | $1.42M | — |
| Alpha Boston | $0 (no model) | $496K | — |
| Alpha Miami | $1.20M | $1.37M | +$165K (+14%) |
| Austin Spyglass | $719K | $1.04M | +$325K (+45%) |
| Alpha HS Austin | $657K | $953K | +$297K (+45%) |
| Nova Austin | $122K | $400K | +$278K (+229%) |
| Alpha Santa Barbara | $220K | $750K | +$530K (+241%) |

Three patterns:
1. **Pre-opening schools with no approved model** (Piedmont, Palo Alto, Boston) — $3.7M in buildout with no budget benchmark. These need retroactive models.
2. **Established schools that crept** (Miami, Spyglass, HS Austin) — 14-45% over approved budgets. Explainable if scope changed, problematic if not.
3. **Small schools that blew up** (Nova Austin 229% over, Santa Barbara 241% over) — small base amounts, but the % tells you process broke down.

### Schools On or Under Budget

| School | Approved | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Alpha Scottsdale | $107K | $67K | -$40K (-37%) |
| eSports Austin | $60K | $60K | On budget |
| Brownsville | $105K | $105K | On budget |
| Multiple microschools | $25K | $25K | On budget |

The $25K microschools are holding. The issue is concentrated in larger buildouts where scope and cost weren't locked.

## 5. The Schools That Matter Most

### Top 5 by Total Annual Cost

| School | Annual Cost | Enrollment | Cap | Util. | Cost/Student |
|--------|------------|-----------|-----|-------|-------------|
| Alpha Miami | $3.75M | 69 | 184 | 38% | $54,376 |
| Alpha NY | $3.66M | 33 | 123 | 27% | $110,842 |
| Alpha HS Austin | $2.89M | 61 | 206 | 30% | $47,439 |
| Austin Spyglass | $2.67M | 212 | 212 | 100% | $12,584 |
| GT School | $2.01M | 21 | 180 | 12% | $95,870 |

**Austin Spyglass is the proof point.** At 100% utilization, cost per student drops to $12,584 — well within model. Every other top-5 school is under 40% utilized, driving per-student costs to $47K-$111K.

**Alpha NY at $111K/student** is the most expensive seat in the portfolio. $1.2M in transportation alone, 27% utilized.

**GT School at 12% utilization** — 21 students in a 180-seat building. $96K per student.

### Schools at or Near Capacity (The Model Works Here)

| School | Util. | Cost/Student | Tuition | Fac as % of Tuition |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Austin Spyglass | 100% | $12,584 | $40K | 31% |
| Brownsville | 76% | $13,053 | $15K | 87% |
| Alpha Scottsdale | 87% | $13,182 | $40K | 33% |

When schools fill up, the unit economics work. Spyglass and Scottsdale have facilities at ~32% of tuition — sustainable. Brownsville is the outlier: even at 76% utilization, the $15K tuition can barely cover $13K in facilities costs.

## 6. Revenue Gap: $53.9M Between Here and Full

| Metric | Current | At Capacity | Gap |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Revenue | $21.0M | $74.9M | $53.9M |
| Fac % of Revenue | 118% | 33% | — |
| Seats to fill | — | 1,348 | — |

The entire financial thesis depends on filling seats. Every unfilled seat is carrying its share of $24.7M in fixed and semi-fixed costs with zero revenue offset.

---

## 7. What This Means

1. **The model works at scale.** Spyglass proves it. Fill seats → unit economics work → margins appear.

2. **The model breaks at low utilization.** Nine pre-opening schools and several at <30% utilization are burning cash. Every month of low enrollment compounds the problem.

3. **CapEx process needs guardrails.** $6.9M in overruns (114%) on a $6M budget. Three schools had buildouts with no approved model at all. Going forward: no buildout without an approved CapEx budget, and variance tracking from day one.

4. **Transportation and food are the hidden costs.** Student services is $6.9M — 28% of total. Alpha NY's $1.2M transportation line is larger than most schools' entire facilities budget. This category deserves its own review.

5. **Low-tuition schools have structural problems.** Brownsville at $15K tuition spends 87% on facilities even at 76% utilization. The math doesn't work unless you dramatically cut cost or raise tuition.
