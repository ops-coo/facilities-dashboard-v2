# Facilities Cost Analysis — Executive Overview

## The Problem

The approved model budgeted ~$14.4M for facilities across 26 schools. Actual cost: ~$25.6M. That's an **$11.2M overrun — 78% over model**.

This isn't a one-school problem. It's portfolio-wide.

## Three Things That Matter

### 1. Facilities OpEx is eating the economics

| | Model | Actual | Gap |
|--|-------|--------|-----|
| **Portfolio total** | $14.4M | $25.6M | +$11.2M |
| **Per student (capacity)** | ~$7,400 | ~$13,100 | +$5,700 |

The model underestimated what it costs to run these buildings. Three cost lines drive ~40% of all facilities spend:
- **Food Services** — ~$5.4M
- **Security** — ~$3.0M
- **Transportation** — ~$1.9M

These are the vendor renegotiation targets.

### 2. CapEx cash exposure is concentrated in new buildouts

$11.5M total CapEx deployed. But the distribution is bimodal:
- **Established MicroSchools:** ~$25K buildout each
- **New Growth/Alpha locations:** $400K–$1.8M each

Top 5 schools = ~57% of all CapEx. Piedmont alone: $1.77M. Palo Alto: $1.42M. The per-seat formula ($500–$1,000/student/yr) didn't anticipate this.

### 3. Most schools can't reach target margin — even at full capacity

The model predicted positive margins. Reality: facilities costs are structurally too high for most schools to hit their tier target (5–20% depending on tuition), even with every seat filled.

~57% of annual facilities cost is locked in (lease + depreciation). The controllable portion — facilities operations and student services — is where to focus.

## Portfolio at a Glance

| | |
|--|--|
| Schools | 26 (3 Alpha, 7 Growth, 10 Micro, 3 Alt, 3 Low Cost) |
| Capacity | 1,955 seats |
| Enrolled | ~622 (32% utilization) |
| Annual facilities cost | ~$25.6M |
| CapEx deployed | ~$11.5M (one-time) |
| Cost/sqft (building ops) | Above premium private K-12 benchmarks at most locations |

## What to Do About It

1. **Vendor contracts** — Food services, security, and transportation are the three largest controllable lines. Renegotiate or rescope.
2. **New school buildout standards** — The $25K MicroSchool buildout vs $1.7M Growth Alpha buildout is a 70× difference. Future CapEx budgets need to reflect actual cost, not formula rates.
3. **Model revision** — The approved model's facility $/student assumptions are wrong for every school type except established Alpha Schools. Update Col W.
